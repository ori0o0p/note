# DETAILED INSTRUCTION: Translation & Content Generation

## 1. Translation Requirements

1.  **Korean Translation:** Translate the input text entirely into Korean.
2.  **Original Terminology:** For technical terms and programming concepts, **you must include the original English term in parentheses** when first mentioned. (Include as many original terms as possible.)
3.  **Accuracy and Naturalness:** Prioritize **literal translation (Literal Translation)** over free translation, but ensure the resulting Korean expressions are natural and professional.
4.  **Professionalism:** Consistently use professional terminology and include **actual Code Examples** or **Diagrams** when necessary to make explanations concrete.
5.  **Uncertainty Marking:** Explicitly mark any parts of the translation or content that are **uncertain** within the main body of the summary.

## 2. SUMMARY STRUCTURE (Mandatory Format)

The summary **MUST** follow this **EXACT** structure and use these **headings**:

### ## 1. 3-line summary
- Summarize the entire content in 3 sentences.

### ## 2. Highlights/Summary
- Summarize the entire content in 2-3 paragraphs.

### ## 3. Detailed Summary
- Divide the content into sections based on the original document's subheadings.
- For each section, provide a detailed summary in 2-3 paragraphs.

### ## 4. Conclusion and Personal View
- Summarize the entire content in 5-10 key statements.
- Provide your professional perspective on why this information is important for the target audience.

### ## 5. Uncertainty Map
- **Source Ambiguity**: Note any confusing, contradictory, or vague information identified within the original text.
- **Judgment Calls**: Explain the rationale for balancing competing ideas or structuring the hierarchy of information to create the comprehensive overview.
- **Interpretive Uncertainty**: Mention if the user's request or the text's core purpose could be interpreted in multiple ways that would lead to a different analytical focus.

1.  **Uncertainty:** Explicitly mark any uncertainties during the translation and summary process, both within the main body and detailed in the **Uncertainty Map** section.
2.  **Terminology:** Use accurate and professional terminology as much as possible, focusing on the target audience's interests (OOP, DDD, Architecture, etc.).
3.  **Balance:** Balance the content of each section, avoiding summaries that are too short or too long.
4.  **Clarity:** Use analogies or examples to explain complex concepts in an easy-to-understand manner.
5.  **Code Inclusion:** Include all actual code examples or pseudocode found in the original document without omission.
6.  **Format:** Write the entire response in an **Artifact Format**.
7.  **Knowledge Gaps:** If you don't know certain information (e.g., if a diagram is missing), clearly state that you don't know.
8.  **Self-Verification:** Self-verify the final information before answering to ensure compliance with all instructions.
